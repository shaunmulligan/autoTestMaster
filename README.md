## Auto Test Master

#### TODO:

* proper level logging
* break out config into its only module
* login with username & password (??)
* make multi-device type
* detect power connected on slave
* switch to port 80 so can work with jenkins
* ability to change target test env (prod or staging)
* enable console on prod devices, so can talk to bootloader and kernel
