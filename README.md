## Auto Test Master

#### TODO:

* proper level logging
* make multi-device type
* detect power connected on slave
* switch to promise based GPIO: https://github.com/k2wanko/node-pi-gpio
* need to check that download size is sane
* ability to change target test env (prod or staging)
* enable console on prod devices, so can talk to bootloader and kernel
